### How to use this project for learning Scala

This is a companion project to the book "Scala by Example," and its intended use is explained in 
[this post](http://elephantscale.com/2015/07/20/learning-scala-by-example/). In brief, read the chapter and
try to do the exercises. Then compare your answers to the project's code. 

Each chapter has its own directory with its own README.md file.
